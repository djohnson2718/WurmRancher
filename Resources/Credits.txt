Wurm Rancher, v1.0
concept and programming by Drew Johnson
created using Microsoft Silverlight 5

I would love to hear any comments or suggestions!  Please email me at werd2.718@gmail.com.

I did the artwork for the creatures and plants, but I don’t have the patience or skill to make them look good.  If you would like to collaborate by doing some artwork, please email me!

Thanks to Marcel Vijfwinkel of cgtextures.com for making available the awesome pictures used in the background.

Thanks to Deceased Superior Technician for making available the great music you hear in Wurm Rancher at www.nosoapradio.us.

Thanks to Jeff Wilcox for posting his style template so the pop-up windows look sweet instead of stupid!
